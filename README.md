# Git-in-Python

This Python script emulates basic Git operations such as repository initialization, file addition, and committing changes. It's designed for educational purposes to illustrate how Git interactions can be simplified into Python functions, without performing actual network operations or repository management. This approach helps in understanding the foundational concepts of Git operation within the Python environment.

## Features

- Initialize a new Git repository.
- Add files to the staging area.
- Commit changes with a message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system to run the script.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

### Initialize a Repository

```python
init("example_repo")
```
This command creates a new directory named `example_repo` and initializes it as a Git repository.

### Add a File

```python
file_path = "example_repo/test.txt"
write_file(file_path, b"Hello, world!")
add(file_path)
```
This adds a new file named `test.txt` to the repository with "Hello, world!" as its content.

### Commit Changes

```python
message = "Initial commit"
author = "Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
commit(message, author)
```
Commits the added file to the repository with the specified commit message and author details.

## Note

This script is a simplified illustration and does not interact with real Git repositories or remote servers. It's intended for educational use to understand basic Git operations programmatically.
